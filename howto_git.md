useless_bashes
==============

this folder was made for learning git & github, 
and has nothing to do with bashes (oldou (although) i pushed bashes in /bash_desktop.

So to learn : 
1.buckysroom.com:
	-git(10 vids)
	-git&github(11 vids)
2.these tips:
	-checkout
	-branch

SO:
a)you can make new branch <git checkout -b new_branch> or <git branch new_branch>
to go in new branch <git checkout new_branch>
b) usefull <git branch>

c)to go to certain commit: <(git) checkout 98dcktk...>
now do: <(((git ))) branch> (will see detached at 98dce...)
so detached head <=> temporary branch. to undo it just <git checkout master>
